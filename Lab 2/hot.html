    <h1>What is a hot Pumpkin Spice Latte</h1>
    <p>The original Hot Pumpkin Spice Latte was developed in early 2003 at Starbucks' "Liquid Lab" in Seattle, born from a mission to find a worthy autumnal successor to the successful Peppermint Mocha. Led by product manager Peter Dukes, the development team experimented by pouring hot espresso shots directly over slices of pumpkin pie to determine which spices best enhanced the coffee's flavor. Despite initial consumer surveys ranking pumpkin flavor lower than chocolate or caramel options, Dukes advocated for the unique profile, leading to a successful 100-store test in Vancouver and Washington, D.C., in the fall of 2003. The hot version officially rolled out across the United States in 2004, and while it didn't actually contain real pumpkin until a 2015 recipe change, it quickly became a cultural icon and the company's most popular seasonal beverage of all time.</p>
