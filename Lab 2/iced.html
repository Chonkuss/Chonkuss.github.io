    <h1>What is an iced pumpkin spice latte</h1>
    <p>The Pumpkin Spice Latte was developed in early 2003 at Starbucks' "Liquid Lab" in Seattle, where a team led by Peter Dukes sought a fall successor to the popular Peppermint Mocha. To find the perfect flavor profile, the researchers spent months sampling forkfuls of real pumpkin pie followed by sips of espresso to identify which spices—specifically cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves—best complemented the coffee. Originally dubbed the "Fall Harvest Latte," it was renamed the Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) and tested in 100 stores in Vancouver and Washington, D.C., that October before its 2004 national rollout. Despite having no actual pumpkin for its first 12 years, the drink became a billion-dollar cultural phenomenon and a social media icon, eventually leading Starbucks to add real pumpkin puree to the recipe in 2015 to meet consumer demand for authenticity.</p>
